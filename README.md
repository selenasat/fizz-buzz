- For each number from 1-100, the program prints the number (using console.log)
- If the number is evenly divisible by 3, the program also prints "fizz"
- If the number is evenly divisible by 5, the program also prints "buzz"
- If it's evenly divisible by both, it prints "fizzbuzz"
- The program should use a method to determine what to print.
